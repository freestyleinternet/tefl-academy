                            <span>A. Best reputation, best resources, recognized worldwide.</span>

                            <span>A. It was great! The whole weekend was full of useful information given by clear and engaging methods. The teacher was lovely and a friendly and helpful attitude was contagious among the students. I can really see myself teaching a class of my own after learning how to plan and manage a classroom, and the practice lesson gave me a positive boost of confidence.</span>

                            <span>A. She had a fantastic, yet relaxed attitude to teaching and she knew what it was like to be in our position and, as a result, had all the right answers to our questions. She was clear and engaging and left me feeling confident that I had taken in everything that I need to know to teach my own class.</span>
