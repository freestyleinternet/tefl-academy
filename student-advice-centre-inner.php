                <p>It’s very much dependent on the cost of living in that particular country. A good website to look at is <a href="#">http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/</a></p>
                <p>You’ll be able to look at the cost of eating out, utility bills, clothing, rent and so on. By being informed about these costs you’ll be able to work out whether you’re going to receive a good wage or not. Also, it’s worth finding out which of these, if any, are covered by your company. At first a salary may look on the low side but your company might cover your rent, in which case it’s probably worth consideration.</p>

                <p>If your intention is primarily to make money and come back with some savings, then the top five places according are Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and The United Arab Emirates. In Vietnam, the teaching package is unlikely to cover much, if anything, in the way of rent and insurance, but the cost of living is so low that your overheads will be minimal. Japanese wages aren’t that impressive at first glance and certainly nothing like they used to be. However, they usually come with an attractive teaching package. Like Japan, Korean teaching jobs often cover your return airfare, heath insurance and free or reduced rent on your apartment. There are fewer teaching jobs in Taiwan which can equal the teaching packages in both Japan and Korea but the cost of living is much lower. The number one spot to teach TEFL in 2012 was the United Arab Emirates. The cost of living in Dubai is high, as you might expect. Despite this, your company will typically offer you free accommodation and your return flight ticket. On top of this you’ll be able to head home with significant savings at the end of your stay.</p>
                <p>If you know anyone who has lived in the country where you intend to work, they can be an invaluable source of information about how much it costs to live there and whether your salary would cover this. Better still, you could always get in touch with one of the teachers at the school where you’re going to work. I’m sure your new employer would be happy to put you in touch with someone. If you don’t know anyone with personal experience of living in that country, then it will easy enough to post your questions on a discussion board on an online TEFL website.</p>
